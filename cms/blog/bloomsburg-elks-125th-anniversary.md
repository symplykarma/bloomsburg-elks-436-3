o kick off our year-long celebration, we are hosting an event on May 12th at 4:00 PM. Please note that this event is for members and guests only and not open to the general public. Nikki and Bill from the band "Last Call Beautiful”, will be providing the music starting at 7 PM. We will have appetizers, desserts, hot dogs, and other snacks available, so please come and enjoy the festivities.

We are offering 125 Anniversary Rtic Cups for just $15 at all our events while supplies last. Don't miss out on getting your hands on these unique cups!

Please call about our sponsorship levels and event dates. We have multiple sponsorship opportunities available, including the Anniversary Sponsorship, Annual Golf Tournament, Band Sponsor, and especially the 125th Celebration Program.

To be part of the 125th Anniversary Program is very easy:  You can have a business advertisement, write a memoriam of a loved one or passed member, and provide recognition or kudos to current members or Board members. Some examples are: Businesses may have their logo listed with their ad, memorials will say in memory of “Name of Person” from “name of family or friends”, as well as you can even say Happy 125 from the “your Family’s names listed here”.  Please give me a call or email if you have any questions.  Happy to discuss the options with you.    

We would be grateful for your support in making this year-long celebration a memorable one. Please consider one of our sponsorship opportunities, and we will provide recognition for your generosity throughout the year.

Thank you for being a part of the Bloomsburg Elks Lodge #436, and we look forward to celebrating with you all.

Sincerely,

Jeff Turner
